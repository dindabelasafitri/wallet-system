Simple wallet system built with OOP in Python

# Python Wallet System (OOP Mini Project)

A simple wallet simulation system built using Object-Oriented Programming in Python.

This project demonstrates how a backend-style wallet service might be structured, including user management, balance handling, inheritance, and custom exceptions.

## Features

- User & PremiumUser classes
- Deposit functionality
- Encapsulation (protected balance)
- Inheritance & Polymorphism
- Service layer via WalletManager
- Custom exception handling

---

## Concepts Used

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Inheritance
- Method Overriding
- Encapsulation
- Exception Handling
- Basic Service Architecture

## Project Structure

Single-file implementation (for learning & simplicity):
wallet_system.py

## How to Run

python wallet_system.py
• Example Output


100000
105000.0
(Premium user receives 5% bonus on deposit.)

• Purpose
This project was built as part of a backend learning journey focused on:
• Writing clean OOP code
• Structuring logic like a service layer
• Preparing for more advanced backend
